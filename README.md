# 📘 Stationery-shop-billing-system
A simple C++ console application that simulates a billing and stock management system for a stationery store called ABC Stationery Store. It uses OOPS concepts like inheritance, friend functions, and dynamic memory allocation to manage product listings, handle customer purchases, calculate the total bill with tax, and monitor item stock levels.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Product List Display**: The program displays a fixed list of stationery items (pens, pencils, books, etc.) with their prices.
2. **User Input**: The user enters how many products the customer is buying and selects each product by item number and quantity.
3. **Billing**: The program calculates subtotal for each product, adds them, and applies a 5% GST.
4. **Stock Management**: After billing, the system reduces stock levels and warns if any product falls below 5 units.
5. **OOP Structure**: The code uses base and derived classes, and friend functions for operations like bill calculation.
